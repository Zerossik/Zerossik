## 🚀 Projects
### [Pizzashop](https://github.com/Zerossik/pizzashop) | [Live page](https://zerossik.github.io/pizzashop/)
Adaptive landing page for a small pizzeria. The website allows users to choose a pizza, select its size, and add extra ingredients, after which they can proceed to checkout.
The site is built using the following technologies: HTML, CSS (SASS), and JavaScript (ES6).
For product cards and the shopping cart, I used the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) and Observer patterns.
To track data changes, I created my own implementation of a useState hook based on ProxyObject.
The slider (for mobile and tablet versions of the site) is built with Swiper.js (Web Components).

### [TService](https://github.com/Zerossik/service-center_rest-api)
REST API for managing a service center and its requests. Implemented authorization 
with full data isolation, CRUD operations for requests and contacts, management of technicians, 
and flexible settings (device types, manufacturers, tables, theme). All data is stored in MongoDB, 
with support for search, filtering, and sorting.
